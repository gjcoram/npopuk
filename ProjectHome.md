nPOPuk is an ultra-small, but comprehensive, e-mail client that runs on a wide range of Windows-based operating systems.

nPOPuk is based on a program originally created by Tomoaki Nakashima. If you wish to compare nPOPuk with Tomoaki's original visit the English language page at his nPOP site.

The new nPOPuk offers a dramatically expanded feature set, but the data files are not backwards-compatible with the original nPOP. This accounts for the decision to change the name. nPOPuk was chosen as it was programmed and compiled by a group co-ordinated from the UK.
